## About This App

This app is a React, Redux, and Firebase project that allows the user to create a post associated with a location on a map and share it with the other logged-in members of the app.

## App's Current State

Currently, users can create an account, log in and log out, create a post with a title and text, and share the post with the community. There is a dashboard that displays all of the posts and a section that displays live notifications of the three most recent posts from any user. I am currently working on implementing the map features so that a user can associate their post with a particular location.

## Future Plans For This App

In this app, a user will be able to use their current location or click on the map to drop a pin and write a post to be associated with that pin location. Users will have profiles with a list of all of their posts and a map displaying all of the post locations. Users will be able to view each other's profiles and if they go to a user's pin location in the physical world and log into the app they will get the option to put a check next to that pin and leave a comment on that post.

## Try The App

Try logging in and creating a new project. A fake email will work fine. Create a new user account, then click on 'New Project' in the navigation bar to create a new post.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### Deploy on firebase

`npm run build` creates the build file. Move contents of the build file into the dist file and replace the dist files.

run `firebase deploy`
